# Taskbar redesign

The plan for turning today's minimal taskbar into a full DeX-style bar — a left launch
cluster, the running-app strip in the middle, and a right system-status tray.

## Current state

[`DesktopPresentation`](../app/src/main/kotlin/com/vspace/desktop/DesktopPresentation.kt)
draws a full-width bar flush with the bottom edge holding three things: an app-drawer
button, a centred strip of one icon per open window (`runningIcons`), and a clock pinned
right. It is a real Android view hierarchy on `Theme.DeviceDefault`, so on a Samsung
device the widgets are styled as One UI.

---

## Target layout

A single horizontal bar in three zones — left and right pinned, middle centred:

```
[ ☰ | ⟳  ▭  🔍 ]      ( app  app  app )      [ 🔊  ✉  📶  ▮▮▮  🔋  12:30 PM ]
  └ left cluster ┘      └ running apps ┘       └─────── status tray ───────┘
```

Build it as a horizontal `LinearLayout` filling the bar width:
`[left cluster] [spacer weight=1] [running apps] [spacer weight=1] [status tray]`.
The two weighted spacers keep the running-app strip centred while the clusters stay
pinned to their edges.

---

## Left cluster

In order: **app-drawer button**, a thin **divider**, then **Recent apps**, **Show
desktop**, **Optometry**, **Search**.

| Item | Action |
|---|---|
| App drawer (`ic_apps`, exists) | Toggles the drawer overlay — `WorkspaceController.setDrawerOpen`. Already wired; just moved to the far left. |
| Divider | A 1dp-wide view at `VSpaceTheme` divider colour, with vertical margins, separating the launcher from the buttons. |
| Recent apps | A panel of apps recently opened **in the workspace** — Android's system recents API is not available to apps, so "recent" means VSpace's own launch history. Needs a small most-recently-used list in `WorkspaceController` (`launchApp` pushes onto it). The panel reuses the drawer's overlay surface or is a small popup. |
| Show desktop | Minimises every open window; a second tap restores them. Each `AppWindow` already has a `minimized` flag — add `WorkspaceController.toggleShowDesktop()` that sets/clears it on all windows. |
| Optometry | Opens the [optometry pseudo-app](OPTOMETRY.md) — a Snellen-style chart overlay for dialling in the VITURE focus wheels. |
| Search | Opens the drawer with its search field focused — `DrawerPresentation` already has the field; add a way to open the drawer *and* request focus on it. |

New vector drawables needed: recent apps, show desktop, optometry (e.g. a stylised eye),
search, and the divider.

## Running apps (middle)

Already implemented — `runningIcons`, one icon per open window, tap to focus, double-tap
to un-maximise. No change beyond moving it into the centre zone of the new layout. A
later refinement: highlight the icon of the front-most (focused) window.

---

## Status tray (right) — full DeX-style

DeX's right edge isn't a passive readout; it's a clickable surface that opens a quick
settings / notifications panel — wifi toggle, bluetooth, mobile data, volume slider,
brightness slider, the notification list. VSpace mirrors that.

### Always-visible row

Right-to-left as the user sees it: **Clock + date**, **Battery %**, **Signal**, **Wi-Fi**,
**Message indicator**, **Volume**. Compact icons; the whole row is one big click target
that opens the panel.

| Item | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Clock + date | `SimpleDateFormat`, re-ticked (exists) | Default: time AM/PM on top, date underneath. 12/24h + date toggles in [SETTINGS.md](SETTINGS.md). |
| Battery | `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED` sticky broadcast / `BatteryManager` | Icon + %, charging glyph when plugged in. No permission. |
| Signal | `TelephonyManager` + `TelephonyCallback.SignalStrengthsListener` (API 31+) | Bars 0–4. Hide on Wi-Fi-only devices. |
| Wi-Fi | `ConnectivityManager` network callback + `WifiManager` RSSI → `calculateSignalLevel` | Connected / disconnected + bars. `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`. |
| Message indicator | `NotificationListenerService` | Dot when there are notifications. Needs notification-access opt-in. |
| Volume | `AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC` | Speaker icon — opens the panel rather than a separate slider. |

### Quick settings panel (DeX-style)

A pop-up panel anchored to the right of the bar — appears on click of the status row,
dismissed by tapping outside or by a `×`. Layout, top to bottom:

- **Time + date** (large), shortcut to a `Settings` gear (opens phone Settings).
- **Brightness slider** — writes `Settings.System.SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS`. Needs
  `WRITE_SETTINGS`, or — easier and uniform with the rest of this list — through the
  privileged helper as `settings put system screen_brightness N`.
- **Volume slider** — `AudioManager.setStreamVolume(STREAM_MUSIC, ...)`. No permission.
- **Quick toggles row** — Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mobile data, Aeroplane, Auto-rotate, Torch.
  Implemented through the privileged helper (`cmd wifi enabled`, `svc bluetooth enable`,
  `svc data enable`, etc.) so VSpace doesn't need each toggle's own permission. State is
  read normally (no permission needed for read).
- **Notifications list** — scrollable. `NotificationListenerService` mirrors current
  notifications; tap dispatches the notification's content intent; long-press = dismiss.

### Wiring

A new `SystemStatus` helper in `:app` owns the read side: registers
`ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED` receiver, `TelephonyCallback` for signal,
`ConnectivityManager` callback for Wi-Fi, `AudioManager` listener for volume,
`NotificationListenerService` for notifications. Exposes flow-style change listeners.

A `QuickSettingsPanel` view (built in `DesktopPresentation` as a child Window /
floating `View` over the workspace) binds the tray + panel views to `SystemStatus` and
calls into either Android APIs (volume, brightness via WRITE_SETTINGS) or the
[privileged helper](PRIVILEGE.md) (wifi/bluetooth/mobile data toggles, brightness as
fallback) for the write side.

The panel is rendered as a normal Android `View` inside `DesktopPresentation`'s view
tree (same `Theme.DeviceDefault` styling as the taskbar), shown/hidden via
`View.VISIBLE` — no extra `UiScreen` or virtual display needed.

## Build order

1. Restructure `buildTaskbar()` into the three-zone layout, all buttons present (most as
   placeholders that just toast). No status reads yet.
2. Left cluster wiring: divider, **Show desktop** (`toggleShowDesktop`), **Search** (open
   drawer + focus), **Optometry** (open the chart overlay), **Recent apps** (workspace
   MRU list + panel).
3. `SystemStatus` helper for the read side; bind the always-visible row — clock (done),
   battery, volume, Wi-Fi, signal.
4. Quick-settings panel scaffold: click the right cluster to open/close. Inside: time,
   brightness slider, volume slider.
5. Quick toggles: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mobile data, Aeroplane, Torch — through the
   privileged helper.
6. Notifications: notification-access opt-in flow, then the list view in the panel.
7. Message indicator wired from the notification listener.

Each step is a separate commit.

**Touch points.** `DesktopPresentation` (three-zone layout, tray row, quick-settings
panel view); new `SystemStatus` helper; new `QuickSettingsPanel` view + a small layout
include; `WorkspaceController` (`toggleShowDesktop`, `setOptometryOpen`, workspace MRU
list, open-drawer-with-search); a `IPrivilegedService.runShell(cmd: String)` method for
the toggles; new vector drawables (divider, recent, show-desktop, optometry, search,
battery, signal, wifi, volume, brightness, message, settings); notification-access
opt-in.
